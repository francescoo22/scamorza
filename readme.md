# ♟️ Scamorza ♟️

**Scamorza** is a chess engine written from scratch in **Rust**.

The goal of this project is to understand how chess engines are built and to learn Rust in depth by developing a
performance-critical, non-trivial application from the ground up.

## 🚧 Status

Currently in early development.  
Scamorza can generate legal moves and pick one at random.

## ✅ Goals

- [x] Bitboard representation
- [x] Legal move generation
- [ ] Evaluation function
- [ ] Search algorithm (minimax / alpha-beta)
- [ ] UCI protocol support
- [ ] Beat the author in a game ♔
- [ ] Further performance optimizations
